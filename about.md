I am Yuxin Li, currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate at School of International Studies at Renmin University of China, specializing in Chinese and Foreign Political Systems. I am under the supervision of [Professor Hong Lin](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9E%97%E7%BA%A2/1669301) of China Political Research Institute at Renmin University of China.

In 2025, I joined <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/zh/">ByteDance</a> as an intern on the TikTok Live-Streaming Ecological Governance team, authoring more than 10 in-depth public opinion reports on platform content trends, user sentiment, and regulatory developments across global markets.

From 2021 to 2022, I served as a Research Assistant for two key initiatives. At the Peking University-Tencent Joint Initiative on the Belt and Road based at the School of International Studies, I supported foreign media monitoring, multilingual translation, and policy synthesis. I also worked with Baohe Safety Technology, an insurance risk management consultancy, where I contributed to real-time media tracking and geopolitical risk analysis.

My research interests include **Populism,International norms,and the Politics of East Asia.**
