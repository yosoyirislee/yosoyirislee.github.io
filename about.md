I am Yuxin Li, currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate at School of International Studies at Renmin University of China, specializing in Chinese and Foreign Political Systems. I am under the supervision of [Professor Lin Hong](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9E%97%E7%BA%A2/1669301) of China Political Research Institute at Renmin University of China.

From 2021 to 2022, I served as a research assistant on two projects: the Peking University-Tencent Joint Initiative on the Belt and Road, based at Peking University's School of International Studies, where I supported foreign media monitoring, multilingual translation, and policy briefing synthesis; and at a Beijing-based Insurance Risk Management Consulting firm, where I contributed to real-time media tracking and geopolitical risk analysis. In 2025, I joined ByteDance as an intern on the TikTok Live-Streaming Ecological Governance team, authoring more than 10 in-depth public opinion reports on platform content trends, user sentiment, and regulatory developments across global markets.

My research interests include populism, international norms, and the politics of East Asia. Currently, I am particularly focused on the U.S. Techno-Industrial Complex as an emerging interest group, examining how technology elites and state actors collaborate to reshape global supply chains and strategic competition.
