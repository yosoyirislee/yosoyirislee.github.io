<p> 💡I enjoy creative hobbies such as photography and crochet. Additionally, I'm an active content creator on <a href="https://xhslink.com/m/9xBkIYBMBkq">Xiaohongshu</a> (China's popular social media platform), where my posts have garnered over 15,000 likes and saves combined, including five viral notes each with more than 10,000 views. </p>

<p> 💡Finally, I also have a cute cat. Her name is liuliu, which in Chinese represents the lucky number 6. </p>
